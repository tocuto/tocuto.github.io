      This was a side project, inspired by a
      <a href="https://youtu.be/bgR3yESAEVE" target="_blank">CGP Grey video</a>,
      the main purpose was for me to learn how to target WebAssembly compilation
      and WebRTC connections using Rust, and while it was not the best decision
      (making the game purely in TypeScript would have made things less
      complicated), I did manage to improve my Rust skills.
      <br /><br />
      The biggest challenge I've faced was establishing a connection between two
      peers: since I wanted to keep this project in a free tier, I wasn't able to
      use WebSockets to connect two clients, or even help with exchanging ICE candidates.
      My solution was to periodically poll a Cloudflare worker which wrote to an
      R2 bucket to perform the signalling process of the WebRTC protocol.
      <br /><br />
      While I could have used an existing signalling server which met my requirements
      (like
      <a href="https://github.com/gfodor/p2pcf" target="_blank">p2pcf</a>), I
      decided to challenge myself to do it from scratch. The main problem I
      faced with this part of the process was avoiding race conditions: when
      both peers published a signal at the same time, one of the signals would
      get lost. I solved this by making each peer have their own signal queue, a
      pointer to the other peer's queue and a pointer to the last received
      signal. This way, a user could only write to their own queue, and only do
      read operations to the other queue, avoiding any possible race conditions.
      <br /><br />
      Overall, while a small project, it was fun to develop and learn how to integrate
      Rust into a web project (hint: I wouldn't recommend it unless there's a good
      reason behind it).
